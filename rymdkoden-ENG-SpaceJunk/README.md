# Space Junk

Mats the satellite is in danger! There is loads of space junk flying around in space and some of it could crash into Mats. Even small pieces can be dangerous so, we should try to clean up as much as possible. 

You are going to create a project using Scratch, one where you are able to save Mats from space junk. You will succeed in saving Mats if you can collect 50 points. You collect the points every time you pick up some space junk. If the space junk touches Mats, you will get a “Game Over” message and will need to start again. 

The end result could look something like this: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/460478570/" target="_blank">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/460478570/</a>

Time to start with your project. This time, instead of creating a new project, you will remix instead. 

Time to start with your project. This time, instead of creating a new project, you will *remix* instead. 

1. Open your browser and go to this link. The link will take you to a project that already contains a few things to get you started like the satellite Mats and a rocket.

2. Click on the **See inside** button, so you can see the code. 
3. Click on **Remix** so that you can duplicate the code and start adding your own code. You must be logged into Scratch to able to remix a project. 

> **Tipa!** If you do not have a Scratch account, you can change things in the project and select **Save to your computer** (under File) when you want to save your project. 

Now you have created a project that includes a spaceship, Mats the satellite and a space backdrop. 

## Jump forward 

You can start the game by making the spaceship move in one direction. You will need two blocks: one code block that says, “when the green flag is clicked” and another code block that says, “move 10 steps”.

Can you join the code blocks together so that your spaceship moves every time you click on the green flag?
