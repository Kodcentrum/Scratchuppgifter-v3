# Space Junk

Mats the satellite is in danger! There is loads of space junk flying around in space and some of it could crash into Mats. Even small pieces can be dangerous so, we should try to clean up as much as possible. 

You are going to create a project using Scratch, one where you are able to save Mats from space junk. You will succeed in saving Mats if you can collect 50 points. You collect the points every time you pick up some space junk. If the space junk touches Mats, you will get a “Game Over” message and will need to start again. 

The end result could look something like this: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/460478570/" target="_blank">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/460478570/</a>

Time to start with your project. This time, instead of creating a new project, you will remix instead.
